## ZeroBot is now archived!
The ZeroBot, which has been offline for quite some time now, will now have to come to an end.
I hereby announce that I will no longer host / maintain it.
Whoever wants to, is welcome to take care of it, the repository will remain online.

Thanks to all!
Thanks for letting the ZeroBot be one of my biggest and longest projects.
